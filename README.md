## About this Car rental system

This Car Rental Booking System is a simple online reservation system which provides the basic tools and features needed to run a car rental business. It provides a simple, step-by-step booking process, and a simple backend administration.

## Intro to my system

With the basic functionality on the system, users in frontend can view, read and request a car to rent, the backend administration can view, update, suspend or delete a car, category or users, can approve or reject car rental requests. add, update, delete or suspend admins or agents to the system.

Although there are some things I was not able to implement them - for any reason - we can add some more features and ideas in future. this implementations couldn't be implemented so far due to the short schedule and some personal urgent matters I faced during project time.

_Some suggested examples of improvements/ideas for the game:_

- Implement a functionality to send approval letters/messages to users in email, SMS or whatsapp.
- Implementation the reports of each main part of the system (agents reports, car reports, categories report, payments reports ... etc).
- Implementing the search functionality in frontend.
- Re-design the system showing to best practice GUI.
- activate the functionality of renting starting rented car and returned status report.
